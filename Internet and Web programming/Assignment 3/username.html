    <h1>Username</h1>
    <p>
        A Username is a special name given to a person to uniquely identify them on a computer network.<br>

        Also called account names, login IDs, or user IDs, usernames are given to a person by the network administrator
        or they are selected by the user.<br>
        In either case, a username may not be the same for more than one person or else it would defeat its intended
        purpose of distinguishing one user from another. <br>
        Email provides the archetypal example of a system or application that cannot be shared, and therefore a person’s
        email address often serves as a default or mandated username.<br>

    <h3 style="color:red">Example: </h3>

        “Username/password is the dominant means of authenticating people to an online service—for now.<br>
        Usernames will survive the evolution away from this security protocol and are most commonly a person’s email
        address, since those are unique and not shared with other users.”
